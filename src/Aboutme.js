              <p>
                A 4th year college student, pursuing my degree as Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering <br></br>
               at Technological Institute of the Philippines Manila, where I'm developing a strong foundation <br></br>
               to be a future Computer Engineer. Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy discovering new <br></br>
               hobbies in different fields such as in music, art, and more,  and I'm always eager to learn <br></br>
               new things and improve. I look forward in using the knowledge I will obtain in Emerging <br></br>
               Technologies in Computer Engineering in the industry someday.
